# izidor's dotfiles

Collection of my various configs (aka dotfiles) and installation scripts.

## Get started

Config files are stored under directory [dotfiles/](dotfiles/). They can be converted to
an instalation script by running:

```shell
./build.py
```

The configs then can be installed throught the generated script:

```shell
./install
```

The configs can be pulled from your home directory to dotfiles:

```shell
./collect.py
```
